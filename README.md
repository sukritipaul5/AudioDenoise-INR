# Audio Dereverberation with   Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)

We intend to combine INRs with Neural Networks to tackle Room Impulse Response (RIR) problems. To this end, we will first obtain the attenuated signals generated from a SOTA neural network for audio denoising/reconstruction. Following this, we integrate time and frequency inputs into the INR to effectively model and mitigate reverberations in diverse acoustic environments. The lynchpin in our research is an INR that represents audio signals in a continuous time domain and would help retain the tail end of the signal. 

To the best of our knowledge, research works have not combined INRs for audio dereverberation for VR use cases. Our work finds direct application in enhancing audio clarity and realism in VR applications.
